        I love code. Below is a selection of some stuff I am working on in my
        spare time.

        Generations have argued. Is anyone right? Who you consider the greatest
        depends on your values. This app asks what you value, and with the power
        of advanced analytics, ranks players accordingly. Coming soon. . .

        I am returning to the church of vi after many years away. It is
        glorious. I don't want to use the mouse ever again. I have spent way too
        many hours configuring my neovim setup. I started with kickstarter, then
        I ruined that configuration. Now I switched to my own customized version
        of AstroVim. Week by week, I will morph this beast into my perfect IDE.
