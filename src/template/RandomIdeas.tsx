        My tentitive plan for my master's thesis. I think we have tunnel vision.
        Why must we use enormous matrix multiplications for all our AI models?
        There is many ways to accomplish multilinear regression. Neural networks
        are just one.

      <p>
        I think we can create a more efficient neural network that replaces
        primative nodes with atomic code blocks. Why ought neural network nodes
        be constrained to weights and biases?. What if some nodes were
        stochastically assigned to be pointers to chunks of code?
