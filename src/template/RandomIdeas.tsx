        Why ought neural network nodes be constrained to weights and biases?
        What if some nodes were stochastically assigned to be pointers to chunks
        of code?

        It would completely mess up the matrix multiplications used at the
        moment, but I keep thinking that I should test this out some time and
        see what happens.
